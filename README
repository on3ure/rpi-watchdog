dtparam=watchdog=on in /boot/config.txt

edit /etc/systemd/system.conf and set RuntimeWatchdogSec to your preferred value, like 30s for 30 seconds. Run systemctl daemon-reload to apply the change.

You can use wdctl to confirm the watchdog is available, which gives you a little more info than looking to see if /dev/watchdog is present.
